# Midnight Cabin Panel

This repo contains the code for the Midnight Cabin panel, which will be used by attendees. It includes a news feed, events calendar, user info, leaderboard, in-event shop, and more coming soon!

It works via a Notion DB, so we can easily update the content during the event from the same platform we use to manage it.

It also uses Slack as the login system, so people can log in with their Hack Club account.

## Pages

- **Home**: Displays the latest news and upcoming events (3 of each) as well as experience and time left until Midnight Cabin ends.
- **News**: Shows the latest news.
- **Events**: Shows the calendar of events.
- **Store**: Displays the in-event shop where users can buy items with their experience points.
- **Profile**: Displays user info, including their experience points, invite QR, and team.
- **Leaderboard**: Shows the top users and teams by experience points.
